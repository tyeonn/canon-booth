###Challenge
[Canon Challenge](http://accelerate.im/challenges/247)
Get access to Canon’s all new Camera Control API and develop a creative application of your own. The CCAPI is a RESTful API that connects via Wi-Fi to simplify integration. Create a working application in a clean format. The application must be considered to be the best use case of the CCAPI provided. The application you design is entirely up to you. The most creative and impressive use of Canon’s CCAPI will win. Canon will award efficiency creativity and innovation as the deciding factors in the use case. Essentially use the functionality of the CCAPI to create the best Image Acquisition and/or Remote Camera Control application that you can think of.

### Problem
My team wanted to tackle the problem of professional headshots being expensive and time consuming. Canon Booth is a photobooth that provides users with a high quality camera and remote access to the camera using a mobile device. With the provided device, users will be able to control the settings on the camera and take a picture all while sitting in the perfect position. 

### Architecture and Technologies

This project is implemented with the following technologies:

- `CCAPI` Canon's Camera Control API to allow us to remotely access the camera
- `React` for the frontend 
- `JavaScript` for event handling and making requests to the API
- `CSS` for styling

### Implementation

####  Presets
Users can choose a preset that has the most optimal settings for that type of picture.

#### Camera Settings
Using sliders, users can change multiple settings on the camera and view the changes on the screen. After choosing the settings, users can take a picture directly from the mobile device.
